# How Can I Use The Colours?

1. Choose your source:
 * Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MaterialDesignColors/) ```Install-Package MaterialDesignColors```
 * Manually pull from [Themes](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignColorsInXamlToolkit/tree/master/Themes) directory and include in your project
2. In your App.XAML choose the primary palette and secondary palette, and configure standard brushes, as in [this example](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignColorsInXamlToolkit/blob/master/MaterialDesignColors.UniversalExample/App.xaml) (this is identical for WPF/WinRT)
3. Make colourful things.
4. Want help choosing your palette? Try the [Palette Builder](https://rawgit.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit/master/web/PaletteBuilder.html) (this is very much a work-in-progress)
 
# How Can I Use The Themes?

* Install [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MaterialDesignThemes/) ```Install-Package MaterialDesignThemes```
* Import required resource dictionaries, and use styles as desired.  For examples, see the MaterialDesignColors.WpfExample project in the source code.

# A Brief History

In creating a Material Design TabControl theme for [Dragablz](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/Dragablz), the first step was getting hold of all the colours.  The resulting resource dictionaries work well stand alone, so are completely re-usable. 

Then I took a step further and created a few simple styles which turned out looking OK.
